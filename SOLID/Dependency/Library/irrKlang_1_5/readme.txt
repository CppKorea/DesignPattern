1. Directory structure overview
==========================================================================

  You will find some directories after decompressing the archive in which
  came the SDK. These are:
  
  \bin         The compiled library irrKlang.DLL and some compiled demo 
               and example applications, just start them to see the 
               Irrlicht Engine in action.
  \doc         Documentation of the Irrlicht Engine.
  \examples    Examples and tutorials showing how to use the native engine
               engine using C++.
  \example.net Examples written for the .NET version of irrKlang, in C# and
               VisualBasic.NET
  \include     Header files to include when using the engine.
  \lib         Lib to link with your programs when using the engine.
  \media       Sound data for the demo applications and
               examples.
  \plugins     Source and documentation of the irrKlang plugins.


==========================================================================
2. How to start
==========================================================================

  To see the engine in action in Windows, just go to the \bin\Win32
  directories, and start some applications. 
  
  To start developing own applications and games with the engine take 
  a look at the 01.HelloWorld example in the \examples directory.

  Windows Users: 
  There are Visual Studio as well as CodeBlocks projects for the examples.

  Linux users: 
  Just go into the /examples directory and run 'make' for every
  example you want to try out. You can run the examples directly from the
  directory they are created in. Some examples may print some special
  hints after a successful make and might help you starting them up 
  by typing in 'make run'.  
  
  Mac users: 
  There is a XCode project for each example available in 
  the corresponding example directory. To run the precompiled example
  applications from bin\macos-gcc, doubleclick the run_0x_xxxxx.command
  files from the finder (this will change the working directory to
  bin\macos-gcc) or start them directly from a terminal.
